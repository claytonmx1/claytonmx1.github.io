## Welcome to Clayton's Eportfolio

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure

#### Original Project Described
The artifact that I chose for this section is from my CS-405 Secure Coding class. This artifact shows my skills in catching exceptions and exception handling when programming. I selected this artifact because exception handling is important when programming because without it the program can crash or have bugs and maybe even bad exploits, for example buffer overflow exploits by the stack being overwrote. This artifact has multiple exception catching and handling techniques.

#### Enhancements Made
I enhanced the selected artifact by adding the ability to catch division part of the exceptions. I learned alot by enhancing my artifact, I learned about using try/catch statements and how I could utilize this to catch and handle exceptions and prevent bugs and program crashes.

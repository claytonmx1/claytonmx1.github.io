## Welcome to Clayton's Eportfolio

### Ehancement One: Software Design And Engineering

#### Original Project Described
The artifact I chose for this section is from my previous class, CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering. This Orignal file is coded in C++ and it gives the factorial for a number the user enters. I selected this artifact because it shows my skils in C++

#### Enhancements Made
I re wrote the code so that it displays a menu that a user can pick from so that the program can be expanded to do much more than just show the factorial of a number entered. I also wrote the pogram in Python as well so that more users can have access to the program. These enhancements show that I am knowledgable in programming in C++ and Python as well as being able to take a program and expand it and make it more available to the user.

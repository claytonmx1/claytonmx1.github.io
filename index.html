							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I I was born and raised in Louisiana and currently reside here. I enjoy fishing, hunting, programming/electronics and gaming. I have always had an obession with computers at a very early age
								and built my first website at around 12 years old. From then on I was hooked, I then branched to learn more about programming and soon started working on small batch files to do little things on WindowsXP.
								Then from there I worked my way to messing with VB.net and then C#, after a while I begin just absorbing as much information I could find about computers and technology in general. 
								Over the years I have built computers for friends and myself, I have made websites for different clients. I have also made C# applications for me and my friends to use for different purposes.
								I have even recently starting working on my own 2D game in the Unity engine. My biggest accomplishment thus far has been recieving my bachelors degree in computer science from SNHU. 
								Although there are not many job opportunities for the software engineering field and application development field or just the software field in general in Louisiana. I am still currently
								trying to find a workplace that I can call home and be a part of something that I have always enjoyed doing, and also enjoy it with others that get the same enjoyment out of their career. I enjoy 
								how when programming you can always find yourself with a challenge and have to come up with a solution, I also enjoy learning more about what I love to do.

									<a href="https://github.com/claytonmx1/StfDelivery"><h3>Food Delivery Website</h3></a>
									<p>During the Covid pandemic, my small town I live in doesn't have Uber or any kind of delivery service other than the post office for your mail. 
										So I took it upon myself to come up with a website that people could use to order food from different resturants in the area and then I would 
										deliver the food to them after seeing their order. I used the sqaure API and PHP along with other languages to custom make a order delivery system. 
										I also used googles API to show a radius and allow users to type in their address to see if they were located in the radius to place an order. The user would call and place their order, 
										then they would create a delivery request on the website in which would ask them the pickup name, order location, delivery location etc. It then would take them to 
										sqaure to pay the delivery fee and I would go pick their food up from the location and deliver it to them, I also coded my own coupon code system as well. I used MYSQL for my backend to keep track of all of the completed deliveries and current. I sadly closed this down 
										due to me starting to work a fulltime job and leave my part time job during school.

									<a href="https://github.com/claytonmx1/DiscordBot"><h3>Discord Bot</h3></a>
									<p>I created a discord bot because my friends and I were playing on a FiveM RP server that had other players on there. You could sell cars, drugs, buy houses, etc. I wanted 
										a way to be able to see who was online on the server but also make things easier like crafting recipes and knowing how much of what items you needed to craft stuff with. 
										So this bot I made would download a file from the website that the owner of the server had for the server and it had the list of currently online players. I then put the information
										recieved from the file into a json file and then displayed this organized to the user in the discord when they typed a certain command. We used this to see what players were online at the time,
										 while also using other commands I made.

									<a href="https://github.com/claytonmx1/RusticRP"><h3>FiveM RP Server</h3></a>
									<p>So I got tired of playing on the server I usually played on. I came up with the idea to make a server and code the plugins I wanted, to make things fun.
										I stopped development after a while on this because I went from a part time job to a fulltime job so I just didn't have the free time to continue anymore. It was definately a learning 
										expierence as I learned alot about LUA etc. *Note the scripts that come with the PLUM ESX server are not included in the repo, only scripts I coded.

									<a href="https://github.com/claytonmx1/Ballout76"><h3>Gambling Website For Fallout76</h3></a>
									<p> I am really proud of this as everything in this project was coded from blank pages and was a big learning expierence with PHP. I had someone approach me and wanted a gambling website similar to the ones that are available for the game Runescape. But they wanted it for Fallout76, this is before 
										the game had came out. So I developed the front and backend of the website and it had dice dueling, poker. I also added a custom system to cash people in and out and 
										an admin dashboard to keep track of everything on the website easier. Unfortunately, since the game had a really bad launch, the client never got to use the website after the launch.

### Enhancement Three: Database

#### Original Project Described
The artifact I chose is from a website that I coded for my aunt that sells candles. She wanted a website so that people that order candles and waxes easier and she could also keep track of stock etc, all while using a database. At the time the website did not have the code to utilize the database.

#### Enhancements Made
I enhanced this artifact by adding some PHP code to utlize the MYSQL database that I am using. I added a way for her to add a new candle or wax melt to the database, so that it can be then displayed on the website. I also added an admin page that queries the database and displays all of the products in a table so that she can just select which ones she wants to delete or update. The enhancements made show my skills in being able to utilize databses to keep track of information and being able to query the information when needed as well as update or delete certain stored info or items in it. The enhancements shown also show me skills in programming through PHP and HTML.

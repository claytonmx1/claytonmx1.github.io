### Professional Self-Assessment and Project Introduction

#### Professional Self-Asessment
This self-asessment composes my expierence and skills that I have gained throughout my time at SNHU in their computer science program. This will show the artifacts that I chose along with the enhancements I made to each of the artifacts, using what I learned throughout my computer science course. This is my final project for the capstone class of the SNHU computer science program.

#### My Educational Journey
My academic journey started in October of 2018 here at SNHU, I was nervouse at first but I can say now it was one of the best choices I have made. I had some expierence with computers and such but most of it was self taught. Up until now I have learned so much and have enjoyed my long journey to getting my bachelors degree in computer science here at SNHU.

#### Program Reflection
Throughout my time here at SNHU, I have learned so much about programming and the computer science industry in general along with different skills to make myself valuable in this field of work. 

Data structures are most related to programming concepts and I have learned that any program that doesn't have a proper data structure and algorithms would stop functioning. It helps reduce the clog of unused and unnecessary code when developing software. I also learned about Git and version control and how it helps when there are more than one person working on developing.

Algorithms are just as important as good data structures, they save time and make the program execute things faster as well as reduce the amount of code that is needed, unnecessary code etc.

Another useful class that comes to mind is the CS-310 course I took. I always knew about Git, but I never knew how useful it was before this and that it can be used to work on programmming projects as a group. This showed me how useful it is to use a platform like Git to keep track of all of your projects and updated you make to them or others might make to them.
